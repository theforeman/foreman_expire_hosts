# foreman\_expire\_hosts

# Context

Foreman makes host creation extremely simple for a sysadmin or a user. However this simplicity leads to wasteful usage of compute resources. The foreman_expire_hosts plugin allows to specify an expiry date for the host. The host will be shutdown first and then automatically deleted after a grace period.

This plugin adds an expired on (date) field to the host form (Additional Information tab). If we create a host with expiry date, then that host will be stopped on the day after the given date and then deleted. If a host has no expiration date set then that host will live forever (until it is deleted manually).

This plugin will send two warning notifications before host expiry (see Settings). It also sends notifications when the host is stopped on its expiry date and when the host is deleted after the grace period (configured in settings).
